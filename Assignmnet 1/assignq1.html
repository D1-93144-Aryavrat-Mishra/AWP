<p>In addition to lists, the text can be “physically formatted” to appear either <b>bold</b> or<i>italicized</i>  or<u>underlined</u>  or
     <strike>strike through</strike> or it could also be <sub>subscripted</sub> or <sup>superscripted</sup>  depending upon the need of the creator.</p>

     <p>
        The text can be made to appear more attractive using of various styles. The <b><i>font</i></b>  tag does this job. The <b><i>face</i></b> attribute can change the font style to whichever it is equated to.
         The size attribute will change the font size which can range from 1 to 7. <font color="red"><b>color</b> attribute will obviously change font color if equated to various combinations of RGB values.</font>
     </p>

<div>
    <p>This apart if the background color has of the document has to be varied then, the bgColor attribute of the body tag can be set or the entire text can be 
        aligned using the align attribute. Indentation with the help of the “paragraph tags” or a new
         line character with a line break can be achieved. Some special characters like copyright i.e. &copy or registered trademark 
        i.e. &reg that are not the part of a standard keyboard can be inserted using the HTML character set. Apart from it, if the &lt &amp &gt signs are to displayed on the browser 
        then corresponding character set equivalent has to be chosen. Text alignment can be either left / center / right; this can be done using the div container tag that has the align attribute. You can set the alignment accordingly.</p>

<div>
    <p>The power of net lies in its capacity to link various web pages scattered over different places on the net. 
        The web pages can be anchored to each other using the a href tags. For instance 
        "&lt A HREF =<font color="blue">http://www.anuda.com/index.html</font>  &gt Click here &lt/A&gt "will link to the website referenced by HREF.
         The user interface becomes better looking if images are included using the img tag. 
         Its attributes<b>src, height, width, align, border etc</b>  will produce corresponding effects. Images can be made clickable if the img tag is contained
          within the anchor tags as demonstrated.</p>

          <p><b>An image is to be inserted exactly at the bottom at the center position, should be square in shape with a border & should display a text when the mouse moves over it. Another clickable image that will lead to a different HTML page should also be inserted
             at the topmost portion of the web page, it should be wide enough to fit almost 75% of the page’s center.</b></p>
